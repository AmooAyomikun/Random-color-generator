What I Learned:
While building this project, I practiced and improved my understanding of:
- DOM selection and manipulation
- Event listeners
- Managing application state (`currentMode`)
- Working with arrays (`push()`, `slice()`)
- Dynamically creating and rendering elements
- Handling user interactions
- Using `setTimeout()` for UI feedback
- Using the Clipboard API
- Writing cleaner, modular functions
